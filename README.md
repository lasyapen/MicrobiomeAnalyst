## MicrobiomeAnalyst Upload Guide
## Overview
This guide walks you through uploading the output files generated by the R script to [MicrobiomeAnalyst](https://www.microbiomeanalyst.ca) for downstream shotgun metagenomics analysis.
 
## Prerequisites
•	MetaPhlAn has been run on your samples
•	The R script has been executed, producing:
1.	An Abundance file
2.	A Metadata file


## Steps
1.	Run MetaPhlAn on your files
2.	Navigate to [microbiomeanalyst.ca](https://www.microbiomeanalyst.ca) and click "Click Here to Start"
3.	Select "Shotgun Data Profiling"
4.	Select "A gene abundance table"
5.	Under Gene ID Type, select "Other gene annotation"
6.	Upload the Abundance file created by the R script
7.	Upload the Metadata file created by the R script
 
## Notes
1.	Ensure your abundance and metadata files are formatted correctly before uploading.
2. Sample IDs in the metadata file must match the column headers in the abundance file.
3. For additional help, refer to the [MicrobiomeAnalyst forum](https://omicsforum.ca/c/microbiomeanalyst/7).
